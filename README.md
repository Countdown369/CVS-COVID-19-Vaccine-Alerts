# CVS COVID-19 Vaccine Alerts
 
 Please note: this project is deprecated, and no longer works. Since vaccines are no longer nearly as difficult to find and schedule as they were in March 2021, I've decided to leave it to focus on other projects.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Sends an email when CVS has available COVID-19 vaccines, so that you don't need to keep refreshing vaccine pages. Keep this script running in the background on your computer (run it via python on the command line). If you'd like help with that, check out this link: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/running-a-python-script
 
 If you use Gmail, you will need to enable "less secure apps" (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) on the email you want the alert to send from; don't worry, I'm not doing anything suspicious, and if you don't trust me the source code is right there. :)

 Works for states other than Massachusetts, but only if you edit the Python file to replace the word "Massachusetts" with your state name. Also, check that your state is one that CVS is doing vaccinations in: https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine
 
 If other's want to edit and improve this, please go ahead! I'm just looking to help people get their vaccines, and I'm no professional developer.
